So, I'm @rue-mionne, most people call me Laura, those close to me call me Aru. This will be my place to "dump" my projects and build some sort of porfolio using those.
Currently using my time being a university student to try out as many things I can and see what works for me.
Working on:
  - C
  - Rust
  - UNIX programming
  - Raspberry PI assembly
