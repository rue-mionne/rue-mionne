So, I'm @rue-mionne, most people call me Laura, those close to me call me Aru. This will be my place to "dump" my projects and build some sort of porfolio using those.
Currently using my time being a university student to try out as many things as I can and see what works for me.
Working on:
  - C
  - Rust
  - UNIX programming
  - C++


Next project(s) coming up:

  Project 0: Rewriting my old C code using clean code principles (and probably overengineering it in process).
  Project 1: Daily/weekly missions/resources tracker for game (CLI, maybe upgrade to graphical interface)
