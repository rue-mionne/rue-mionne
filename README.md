<p>So, I'm @rue-mionne, most people call me Laura, those close to me call me Aru. This will be my place to "dump" my projects and build some sort of porfolio using those.</p>
<p>Currently using my time being a university student to try out as many things as I can and see what works for me.</p>
<ul>Working on:
  <li><s>C</s></li> 
  <li>Rust (on hold)</li>
  <li>UNIX programming</li>
  <li>C++</li>
  <li>Java</li>
</ul>

Next project(s) coming up:

  <p><s>Project 0: Rewriting my old C code using clean code principles (and probably overengineering it in process).</s> Abandoned, due to a new project for an assingment also needing a clean code practice</p>
  <p><u>Project 1: Daily/weekly missions/resources tracker for game <s>(CLI, maybe upgrade to graphical interface)</s>(WxWidgets based UI with enough abstraction for a possible switch in a future)</u></p>
  <p><u>Project 1.5: Project 1 but with analysis module using genetic algorithm (best solution? not, is it fun? yup), using Java and JavaFX with database support using SQLite</u></p>
